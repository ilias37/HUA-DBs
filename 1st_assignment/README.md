All models were created via drawio so we would recommend opening them via https://app.diagrams.net/

The 1st part of the assignment consists of the file `1st Database Assignment.docx` 
and the file `montelo_OS_1ou_merous.drawio`
The 2nd part of the work consists of the file `sxesiako_montelo_2ou_merous.drawio`.
The 3rd part of the work consists of the file `montelo_OS_3ou_merous.drawio` and the file "sxesiako_montelo_3ou_merous.drawio".

The 3rd part relational model of the job remains the same as the 2nd part relational model except for one change that occurs, so the 3rd part relational model file only contains that change.

In the `assignment.pdf` file there are the requirements of the application.
